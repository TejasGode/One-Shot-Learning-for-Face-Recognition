# One-Shot-Learning-for-Face-Recognition
Its impossible to have thousands or millions of images of a person to train a Face Recognition model. Its better idea to use One Shot Learning to solve this problem.
I used it and got reliable result.

Here, we will use Siamese Network to solve this problem.


I got help from the following:

1) From Video Lectures from Deeplearning.ai by Andrew Ng.
2)FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering  : https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832



Thank You
